# ThelaFinder

<!-- log -->
1) working directory is thela-finder
2) added .env file and updated the API keys
3) ran npm install firebase
4) succesfully read from a firebase database
5) ran npm install @react-google-maps/api
6) created a Map.tsx file which I think is rendering the maps
7) updated the page.tsx file in app folder to show the map
8) updating the firebase, map file to include new type for food, drink for filtering purposes
9) fixing the bug of map recentering to the user location everytime


<!-- To do's -->
1) create a user log in page
2) create a marker design such that when a user adds a new stall, the marker colour is light red, and it gets darker when each succesive user verifies the stall exists. once 10 users verify it, it will become the actual red colour.
3) for this, another feature will be needed to added that is the user can only verify a stall if they are within 50 meters of radius of the stall they are verifying
